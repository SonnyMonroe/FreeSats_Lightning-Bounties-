# Lightning Bounties Bug Bounty Program

At Lightning Bounties, we're pioneering a new era of open-source development powered by Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Our platform is designed to seamlessly connect developers with exciting projects, rewarding contributions with instant Bitcoin payments. We invite developers, bounty hunters, and Bitcoin enthusiasts to join us in enhancing our platform by identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities, helping us build a more robust and efficient system for the entire open-source community.

## Scope

Our bug bounty program covers the following areas:
- **GitHub Repository**: [Lightning-Bounties/repo](https://github.com/Lightning-Bounties/.github/edit/main/profile/README.md).
- **Front-End**:  [Lightning-Bounties/lb-next](https://github.com/Lightning-Bounties/lb-next)
- **Back-End**: Currently set to private for development purposes. See instructions [here](https://docs.lightningbounties.com/docs/solve-a-bounty/working-on-opensource-frontend-lb-next)


## Vulnerability Classifications

- **Severe Vulnerability**: Issues that render a subset of the service unusable or compromise user data.
- **Critical Vulnerability**: Vulnerabilities that make the entire service unusable or grant unauthorized write access.

## Disclosure Process

1. Discover a potential security issue within our scope.
2. Document the vulnerability with clear reproduction steps.
3. Submit your findings via a GitHub issue in our .github repository.
4. Our team will review your submission and respond promptly.
5. Collaborate with us to verify and address the vulnerability.

## Rewards

Lightning Bounties uses its own platform to issue rewards in Bitcoin (sats) for confirmed vulnerabilities. Rewards are distributed based on the severity and impact of the reported issue, leveraging our unique GitHub workflow for Bitcoin payouts.

**Note**: This bounty program focuses exclusively on security vulnerabilities. UI/UX bugs or feature requests are not eligible for rewards under this program.

We appreciate all forms of contribution to the Lightning Bounties project. If you're interested in contributing code, documentation, or other improvements, please refer to our [Contributing Guidelines](https://docs.lightningbounties.com/docs/about-lb/contributing) for more information.


## Final Notes

This bug bounty program is an evolving initiative. We may update these terms and conditions as our project grows and changes. Always refer to the latest version of this document before submitting a report.

Our goal is to create a seamless, secure platform for rewarding open-source contributions with Bitcoin. We welcome any assistance in achieving this mission and securing our infrastructure.

We encourage other Bitcoin and Lightning Network projects to adopt similar bug bounty programs. Feel free to use this template as a starting point for your own initiatives.
